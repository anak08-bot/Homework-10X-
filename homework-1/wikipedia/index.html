        <p> <b>Web Development</b> is the work involved in <i>developing</i> a <a

            development can range from developing a simple single <a

            <br>
            Among Web professionals, <em>"Web development"</em> usually refers to the main non-design aspects of
            building Web sites: writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup</a> and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">coding</a>.<sup><a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Web development may
            use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">content management systems</a> (CMS)
            to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.
            <br>
            <br>
            For larger organizations and businesses, <i>Web development teams</i> can consist of hundreds of people (<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer">developers</a>) and follow standard methods like <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile methodologies</a>while developing
            Web sites.<sup><a href="">[1]</a></sup> Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or
            contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_designer">graphic designer</a> or <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_systems">information systems</a> technician. Web
            development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated
            department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_Web_development">front-end developer</a>, back-end
            developer, and full-stack developer.<sup><a href="">[3]</a></sup> Front-end developers are responsible for
            behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.<sup><a
                    href="">[4]</a></sup> Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become
            one of <strong>the most used technologies ever</strong>.

    <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and Web development</h2>

    <div>
        <h3>Origin/ Web 1.0</h3>
        <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> created the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web"><b>World Wide Web</b></a> in 1989 at CERN.<a
                href=""><sup>[5]</sup></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated information-sharing needs of
            academics affiliated with institutions and various global organizations. Consequently, <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</a> was developed in
            1993.<a href=""><sup>[6]</sup></a>
            <br>
            <br>
            Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material and provide a small amount
            of information.<sup>[7]</sup> Core protocols of web 1.0 were <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a>, HTML and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URI</a>.<sup>[8]</sup>
        </p>

        <div>
        <h3>Web 2.0</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="">Web 2.0</a>, a term popularised by <a href=""><b>Dale Dougherty</b></a>, then vice president of
            O'Reilly, during a 2004 conference with Media Live, marks a shift in internet usage, emphasizing
            interactivity.<sup>[9][10]</sup>
            <br>
            <br>
            Web 2.0 introduced increased user engagement and communication. It evolved from the static, read-only nature
            of Web 1.0 and became an integrated network for engagement and communication. It is often referred to as a
            user-focused, read-write online network.<sup>[7]</sup>
            <br>
            <br>
            In the realm of Web 2.0 environments, users now have access to a platform that encourages sharing activities
            such as creating music, files, images, and movies.<sup>[11]</sup> The architecture of Web 2.0 is often
            considered the "backbone of the internet," using standardized <a href="">XML</a> (Extensible Markup
            Language) tags to authorize information flow from independent platforms and <a href="">online
                databases</a>.<sup>[7]</sup>
        </p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
        <p>
            Web 3.0, considered the third and current version of the web, was introduced in 2014. The concept envisions
            a complete redesign of the web. Key features include the integration of <a href="">metadata</a>, precise
            information delivery, and improved <a href="">user experiences</a> based on preferences, history, and
            interests.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
            <br>
            <br>
            Web 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized database, providing more functionality than
            traditional search engines. Users can customize navigation based on their preferences, and the core ideas
            involve identifying data sources, connecting them for efficiency, and creating user profiles.<sup>[7]</sup>
            <br>
            <br>
            This version is sometimes also known as <a href="">Semantic Web</a>.<sup>[12]</sup>

        <h3>Evolution of web development technologies</h3>
        <p>
            The journey of web development technologies began with simple <a href="">HTML</a> pages in the early days of
            the internet. Over time, advancements led to the incorporation of <a href="">CSS</a> for styling and <a
                href="">JavaScript</a> for interactivity. This evolution transformed static websites into dynamic and
            responsive platforms, setting the stage for the complex and feature-rich web applications we have today.
